**Mir** (Russian: Мир, meaning "peace" or "world") was a [space station] that operated in low [Earth] orbit from 1986 operated by [the Soviet Union](the_soviet_union) until its collapse.

While it was initially intended for strictly scientific experiments, Mir quickly became the focus of the Soviet space warfare initiatives after [the Blizzard].

With the cooperation of [UN-XF] and other, newly appearing "rogue" space agencies, Mir has become by far the largest and most equipped space station of [the alien warfare era](history~1989-2064).

During the [New Age], many myths surfaced claiming Mir successfully activated a [Voidgate] and disappeared to [Deepvoid] at some point; these claimes were not fully verified, however.
