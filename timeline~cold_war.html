## Notable historical divergences

In order to understand geo-politics during and after the alien invasion, certain divergences need to be addressed explicitly.

### Ceaucescu was not executed

Most notably, in Deep Space Blizzard, Ceaucescu was never overthrown. The Blizzard occured before the events of the real-life Romanian Revolution, and while the country was somewhat affected, immediate action was taken.

As such, the '90s saw the transformation of the country to a more extremist communist dictatorship, led by the Ceaucescu Family: Nicolae until his death in 2001, and his oldest son Nicu thereafter.

While not a strong country, also being positioned in a region heavily affected by the initial bombardments, Romania stayed one of the three powers surving to the mid-21st century.

### North Korea collapses

On the other hand, another country well-known today is no more in DSB: Nprth Korea's economy started to decline in late 1987 as a result of famines and inefficiency. When the alien bombardment reached Pyongyang, the complete societal failure was inetivable.

The northern part of the Korean Peninsula eventually became an alien outpost until the victory of the South Korean and American forces in the mid-21st century.

### The Iron Curtain never fell

Due to the immediate threat the combined presence of communist forces and the alien invaders meant, the NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) decided not to open up to the Eastern parts of Europe. Considering the presence of attitudes for ending the divison were already present, some sort of support has eventually formed between certain countries, but every other advance we're aware of today didn't happen in any shape or form.

Among the most important of these, the European Union as we know today never formed, and the Warsaw Pact never ended in its full extent. Germany was also not united, leaving East Germany on its own to fight the invaders - which eventually led to its demise well before the end of millenia.
