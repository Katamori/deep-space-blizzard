**Number Station Omega** is an abandoned and isolated shortwave radio station somewhere in the [Melyavak Forest]. It is the last existing [numbers station] inside [Sanctuary], and is assumed to be transmitting information related to both Sanctuary and [The Zone], the [alien mothership crash site](blank_empire), to an unknown party.



Rumours say it is used by the secret intelligence services of of [the NVG](neon_valley_govenment), but considering it uses various implementations of [alien technology](alien_technology~index) for security and isolation, very few is known for sure about the facility's origin and functionality.

Some theories say it was part of [a larger communication network](bordernode_protocol) even before the [Starshift Period] and that even the involvement of some underground alien conspiracy is not ruled out.
