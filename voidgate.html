A **Voidgate** is a physical gateway to [Deepvoid]. 

Due to the nature of Deepvoid, such gateways are generated in a special and stable way that prevents matter-[antimatter] annihilation. Because of this trait, only objects surrounded by [Aura Shield] are able to pass through such gates, providing maximum safety.

## Voidgate Generator

Any device capable of any sort of Voidgate is noted as a **Voidgate Generator**. It is essential to differentiate the generator device from the rest of any architecture that rather makes use of it only.
