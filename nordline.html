**Nordline** is the given name of the mountain ridge on the northern edge of [Sanctuary], also residing the legendary [Mothership crash site](blank_empire).

Before the [New Age](timeline~new_age_I), the Nordline was subject to extensive mining operations due to its abundance in three major resources: limestone, coal, and uranium; during the centuries, however, most have been depleted.

Due to the presence of various supernatural threats in the region, the Nordline is considered mostly impassable; as such, it marks a natural border of Sanctuary.
