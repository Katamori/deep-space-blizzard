In November 1989, an ever since unidentified alien race performed a full-scale invasion on Earth. This started with [The Blizzard] during the beginning of the month, then went on with the arrival of [thousands of Motherships](alien_technology~mothership) used as command centers for military operations to the onboarding units.

The sudden nature and the sheer scale of the attack incapacitated or completely eliminated many of the Earth governments at the time, up to and including the majority of the nuclear superpowers and led to both a societal and an ecological collapse.

Many people, however, survived both The Blizzard and the initial assault and started organizing resistance and counterattack. Since it later turned out, the aliens were not that superior compared to human technology, their progress was successfully halted.

The invasion ended in 2064, with the recapturing of [Iceland](countries~iceland), the last central operation node of the alien forces, after a slow but steady collapse of the alien army. Historians assume, the central government of the race was either unable or unwilling to supply the invasion with more resources.
