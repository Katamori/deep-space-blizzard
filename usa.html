The **United States of America** (USA for short) was a country of 50 states, a nuclear superpower, and the major political leader of the pre-Blizzard age, opposing [the late Soviet Union](the_soviet_union). Being the winner of the original Cold War era, it fell victim of a slight decline, later sharply accelerated by [the Blizzard] and its long-term consequences.

## History

### Before the Blizzard

### The initial collapse

### During and after the invasion

While the country survived during [the mid-21 century](timeline~1989-2064) and beyond, it required a huge shift in focus towards militarism, extended authority and even the reorganization as a federative alliance of more autonomous states.

Later on, human victory and the peace coming with it resurfaced unhandled societal issues, which led a sharp and steady decline, and eventually the dissolution of the US.

### The Heritage States

### The Starshift Period

As of 269RDA, the only Heritage State [the NVG](neon_valley_government) has ever contacted was [the Everglades Authority](the_everglades_authority) - and even that occured via satellite contact, leading to many speculations about the current state of North America.

## Relationship with the Ancient Nation

Abandoned bunkers in [Neon Valley Underground] bore NATO bearings, indicating that [the Ancient Nation] was, at one point, either an ally of the United States, or even part of one of the states.
