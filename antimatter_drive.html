An **Antimatter Drive** is a miniaturized [Voidgate] Generator specifically designed for harnessing the radiation coming from such an entrance.

Fundamentally, Antimatter Drives are of alien design, but many nations were successfull at reproducing them.

## Working mechanics

On a very high level, an Antimatter Drive is an extremely radiation-reflective hollow orb, suspended in a gyroscopic fashion within a larger container-like structure. When the drive is ignited, a Voidgate is generated within the orb.

## Practical use

Alien-designed drives are specifically used for space ship propulsion only: the produced electricity is channeled to high-perfomance ion drives.

In human design, building reactors was the biggest focus; the first such usage of antimatter harnessing occured in the mid-21st century by [the Soviet Union](the_soviet_union).
