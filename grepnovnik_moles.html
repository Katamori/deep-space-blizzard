The **Grepnovnik Moles** are an underground society founded by the [Night Stalkers] repopulating the bunker system of the [Grepnovnik Group] below the deserts since knowns as [Sanctuary].

They are highly agressive and shoot on sight; their primary objective is to isolate the Alien Mothership crash site preventing contamination to spread to the nearby forests
