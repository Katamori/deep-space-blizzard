**The Ancient Nation** is how inhabitants of [Sanctuary], [the Zone] and many surrounding wastelands and city states refer to the nation or nations inhabited this region of [Earth] earlier in history.

The nation itself had multiple forms of governance and has changed its territory often: it had rich pre-[Blizzard] history and continued to stay a regionally significant power in the [post-Blizzard-era Cold War](timelime~1989-2064) until internal struggles and societal decay has lead to civil war, changes in governance and more up to its complete eradication before [the end of the New Age](timeline~starshift_period).

Because of the sheer time span, no one actually knows, what was the exact position of the Ancient Nation in the original Cold War (aside of being a [NATO] member) and before and how much it resembled its historical self at the end of the New Age.

## Archeological sites

* [Neon Valley] was almost certainly built on a major Ancient Nation settlement; [its underground tunnel system](neon_valley_underground) has led to many speculation about its original intended purpose.
