[Tony]'s main storyline takes place in the year 269 RDA.

The RDA calendar counts the years since the last [Registered Starshift Apparition], which occured in V1140.

RDA is often used due to the implications of an Apparition on human life (such as the sudden series of [Frostwave]s), but for a fix point reference, V, meaning "Year of the Valley" is also used.

V measures the time since the inception of the current governmental structure of [Neon Valley].
