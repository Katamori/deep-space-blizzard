The **Frost** is the name of a unique physical phenomena brought by the aliens to Earth. While basically an extraterrestrial chemical compounds, its molecular structure involves particles not well understood by pre-[Blizzard] science.

## Chemical properties

Frost reacts intensely with silicates, most notably [quartz]. Frost rearranges the crystalline structure of any said category of minerals, hardening it permanently to the point of approaching and even extending that of diamond. Affected material also emits a very weak repelling force against non-affected geologic composition, similar - the nature of this phenomena, albeit unknown, is resembling that of ferromagnetism.
