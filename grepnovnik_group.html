The **Grepnovnik Group** was an elite mercenary unit serving [the Junta](countries~the_junta) during its conflicts with the reigning forces and the various other rebel groups. Its extensive underground bunker system helped them keeping [a position](sanctuary) for extended periods of time, making them a super valuable frontline.

At one point near to the end of the Junta's reign, an unknown assault could access their tunnels and a [Fire Leak] impact cleared all of them. It's hypothesized that the Grepnovnik Group has dissidents and as such, not all of them were killed in the eradication.

Either way, the war ended shortly thereafter, leaving the tunnels unpopulated until the Night Stalkers captured it back and forming the [Grepnovnik Moles], as a tribute to the original mercenary team.

The group was named after *Marshal Zakan Grepnovnik*, their leader; a statue of him was erected near to the southern edge of [Sanctuary], facing the Mothership crash site.
