A **numbers station** (sometimes abbreviated as **number station**) is a shortwave radio station characterized by broadcasts of formatted characters (originally numbers, hence the name), which are believed to be addressed to intelligence agents operating within the borders of foreign factions or countries.

Numbers stations were few and far betweeen during [the Cold War](timeline~cold_war), mostly used by [the United States](usa), but they became especially important and sophisticated after [the Blizzard], mostly on explicitly invaded areas.

[Sanctuary] was filled with numbers stations after the collapse of [the Junta]; many warlords and factions, including [the NVG](neon_valley_government) used them for their own favour up until their region-wise dismantling during [the Consolidation]. As of V1000, the only such station left is [Number Station Omega].

While many conspiracy theories exist about both their prior and continued use (the most notable of which is the [Bordernode Protocol]), none of them are true; the NVG has long abandoned the concept of numbers station in favour of other counterintelligence measures.
