**Fort Montevideo** is an abandoned military complex and fortication located on the border of [Sanctuary], marking the northernmost accesible area before the beginning of [the Mothershipt impact zone](blank_empire).

The facility itself originated from the Old World times, but was most recently managed by the forces of [the Junta] before its collapse. While it was populated by various groups during history, the fort has become permanently uninhabited because of the securing and maintainence roles of [the NVG](neon_valley_government) in the region.

Aside of the vast scale of the surface area, the complex also consists of an extensive bunker system; rumors say it has direct access to the area of the [Grepnovnik Moles] - it is yet to be proven, though, as NVG forces haven't contacted any of them since 8 RDA.

The most notable feature of Fort Montevideo is a 30 meters tall platinum statue of Marshal Zakan Grepnovnik, who used the complex as operations headquarters before securing [the regional frontline](The_Zone).
