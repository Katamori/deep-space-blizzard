An **Alien Interceptor** is a special type of alien fighter spacecrafts that is capable of reaching extremely high speed (up to 90 Mach - even in planetary airspace) and even casting [Voidgate]s on demand.

While having a shape simiar to human-designed interceptors due to aerodynamic considerations, more durable coating and [improved propulsion capabilities](alien_technology~antimatter_drive), as well as certain fine-tuning additions made Alien Interceptors deadly and superior in air-to-air combat.

Primarily deployed in [the Blizzard], many Interceptor survived the initial Earth conflict due to their restricted applicability and improvement in human air defense mechanisms.

## Notable instances

Few Interceptor crash site survived the centuries; some were, however, erected as monuments and/or museum exhibitons.

* **Speedwagon**: the traditional name of an abandoned instance claimed by the [Valley People] in the early decades of [Neon Valley]. In 269RDA, it's defused and disarmaed, and erected as a special, well-guarded statue in the middle of a square of the same name.
    * *Speedwagon* is also the name of a public transport hub not far from here; it is the easternmost station of Metro Line 1C, providing transit to [Perimeter Gate] Charlie.
