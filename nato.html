The **North Atlantic Treaty Organization** (**NATO** for short) was an intergovernmental military alliance between 30 North American and European countries. NATO constituted a system of collective defence whereby its independent member states agreed to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party.

After [the Blizzard], NATO was one of the most important military organizations of humanity to counter the upcoming alien invasion. Eventually it [joined the United Nations](un-xf) in said fight and kept up until humanity's victory in 2064.

While the treaty survived the invasion, later societal and diplomatic changes were proven difficult to keep up for the Old World-established organization, and it was formally dissolved in 2069.
