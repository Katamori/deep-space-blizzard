The **United Nations Extraterrestrial Forces** (abbreviated as **UN-XF**) was a military branch of the [United Nations] founded in response to [the Blizzard] in 1995. Its primary initiative was the creation of a military organization funded by member states which was capable of fighting back against [the alien invasion of Earth](timeline~1989-2064).

Originally consisting of joint [UN]-[NATO] forces, the UN-XF was responsible for the research and development of many [Embedded Extraterrestrial Technology] patents and applications - mostly in military use.

Due to later conflicts and crisises in diplomacy, the United Nations collapsed in 2101, and the UN-XF went with it; the organization itself lived on as [the Extraterrestrial Research Federation](etrf) during the [New Age].
