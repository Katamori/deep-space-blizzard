**Orient Deep** is a large see bordering [Sanctuary] from its southwestern and southern sides. Very few is known about its properties, aside the fact it consists of regular salt-water with slight [Frost] contamination.

It is theorized the [Valley People] came from somewhere on the other side of the sea; legends call this place [Uppuneara].

It is also assumed the name (orient as referring to eastern direction) was given by the Valley People to the sea - archeological evidence proves they somehow have mistaken the coastline facing east, rather than west; reasoning behind this mistake is inconclusive, however.

Orient Deep is proven to have a lush and diverse marine life, albeit with also very dangerous, previously undocumented species.
