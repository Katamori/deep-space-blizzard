**The Void Shard** is a popular underground nightclub and community place, a few corners away from [the Metrocenter NW Gate subway station](metrocenter) in [Neon Valley].

The club consists of three concert halls, a central courtyard, a separate dance floor and multiple pub areas, as well as a series of rehearsal rooms and a VIP and backstage area.

Before and during the active years of [Lord Function], The Void Shard was a major location in [Tony]'s life: a temporary workplace, and the major space of meeting his fellows.
