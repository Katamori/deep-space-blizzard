**Quartz** is the official currency of [Neon Valley] and the most widely accepted in [Sanctuary].

In written communication, Quartz is noted as a small 'q', as in `Price: 400q`.

## History

Quartz as a crystalline mineral is composed of silicon and oxygen atoms and is the one of the most abundant minerals on Earth. Intense warfare, however, as well as extensive, large-scale industrial operations in and around Sanctuary has depleted a huge majority of these reserves.

By [the end of the New Age](timeline~new_age_2), all has left was either unobtaible due to its depth, economically unfeasible or outright dangerous to extract, or (in huge majority) was rendered useless by reaction with [Frost] during mass destruction events.

As a result, the turqoise-colored Hardened Quartz has become the symbol of everyday life in Sanctuary. As it was also rare to find in smaller forms, being nearly as hard as diamond, it has quickly become extremely valuable, replacing the meanwhile near-disappeared [gold].

Naturally, the [Neon Valley Government] has exclusive monopoly over the extraction, processing, and usage of hardened quartz; most importantly, in the form of minting Quartz.

## Value

### Examples

Naturally, Sanctuary's economy is unique, meaning that numbers are not representative on their own; however, their scale relative to each other helps understanding the state of the currency better.

* A bottle of decent-quality beer costs 400-600q.
* 1 kg of chicken meat costs 3000-3500q.
* An average citizen in suburbian Neon Valley earns approx. 100 thousand Quartz per month.
