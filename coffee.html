**Coffee** is darkly colored, bitter, caffeinic brewed drink, prepared from the seeds of berries from Coffea trees. It is known for humanity since the pre-industrialization and is still a prevalant and notable beverage in the post-New Age history.

By the 3rd century RDA, coffee in [Neon Valley] is infamously rare. As per safety measures, more than 90% of the city's entire agricultural activity revolves around a gargantuan network of underground caves and hydroponic farms maintained mostly by the government, and a small portion by private corporations. The prairies and wastes in and around Sanctuary were never suitable to host coffee plants in the known history.

As a result, many plants and livestock widespread in pre-[Blizzard] times are extremely scarce in the region. While many other goods earned similar status in the situation (orange, most dairy goods, chili, and so on), coffee was notale among them due to the cultural contrast between its rich culture and small nutritional and enjoyment factor.

By 269RDA, coffe in Neon Valley is analogous to caviar of the pre-[Blizzard] era.

## History

Coffee was almost certainly known by [the Ancient Nation], but lost to the eternal wars - among many other cultural aspects. Its first mention dates back to V-500, when the [Valley People] started settling down in Sanctuary. 

Valley People used so-called "passive heaters", powered by a mechanism not well understood, made out of burlap, metal rods, and exotic chemicals which were used as smoking for coffee plants put inside the sacks. Not much is known about the technology, or the origin of the Valley People, but it's speculated the chemicals they used for cultivation were either of alien origin, or the result of synthesis performed with materials of such origin.
