An **Alien Mothership** is an extremely large spacecraft that is capable of serving and carrying smaller spacecrafts, vehicles and other utilities used in a military operation. A Mothership essentially contains an entire alien military unit, up to and including its full army, staff, and equipment.

Motherships were by far the biggest units deployed by the alien invaders during [the Blizzard]; historians assume their amount were in the thousands.

Due to sabotage actions and the quick adaption of human military technology to extraterrestrial factors, many were destroyed; the rest were forcefully invaded or occupied during the end of the war. As of 269RDA, these are the most valuable so-called "ancient assets" held by any reigning nation on Earth.

## Equipment

### Power source

Motherships had a primary duty in military logistics, the uppermost element of which was to transport units lightyears away. For this purpose, each were equipped with a [Slingshot Drive](alien_technology~slingshot_drive): an extended [Antimatter Drive](alien_technology~antimatter_drive) with the additional ability to create and project a [Voidgate] large enough so that it engulfs the Mothership itself.

Naturally, such a drive has the theoretical power output orders of magnitude larger than a one-function Antimatter Drive.

## Notable instances

[Sanctuary] had only two Mothership wreckages, but it's well documented that hundreds are scattered around everywhere on Earth's surface.

* **Meteor**, NVG codename of the one found deep below the northwestern portion of [Neon Valley].

* ** Nordqueen**, the unofficial name of the one found in the crash site on the southernmost edge of [the Zone].
