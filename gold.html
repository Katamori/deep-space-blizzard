**Gold** is a chemical element with the symbol **Au** and atomic number 79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally. In a pure form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions.

As of 269RDA, gold is all but disappeared from [Sanctuary]. While its knowledge survived through history, and was [successfully synthesized](technology~nuclear_physics) by [Neon Valley] scientists, large-scale usage is deemed unfeasible as the last gold samples were stolen in [the Erling Rebellions].

## history

Historians estimate the theoretical market price of an ounce of gold at the time of the Erliong Rebellions would have exceeded a million [Quartz].
