A **Ricochet** is a small alien fighter spacecraft/aeroplane hybrid usually used in kamikaze fashion.

Ricochet are not bigger than a larger human glider - and is indeed capable of flying in such fashion; however, it's also equipped with an exceptionnaly miniaturized [Antimatter Drive](alien_technology~antimatter_drive). Such a powerful propulsion, combined with its durable, but small and lightweight hull makes the Ricochet the fastest vehicle of any alien design.

Ricochet are multifunctional: with small weight and high speed in mind, they are capable of scout and stealth operations, involving small-scale fights, but their ultimate purpose is to utilize speed for extremely heavy impacts on larger bodies, like bombers or carriers.

The theoretical maximum speed of a Ricochet exceeds 300 Mach (over a hundred kilometers per second), but due to their small weight, they are prone to "bounce back" from Earth's atmosphere in case of an attempted re-entry.

## Working mechanics

### Speed 

In order for the Ricochet to reach such enormous speeds, many extreme design decisions were implemented: the aircraft itself is entirely shard-shaped, without any recognizable detail. Its ion propulsion drive is reshaped to provide a very small output stream for maximizing throttle.

For minimizing fuel consumption during non-essential operations, as well as for making it capable of stealth flying, the Ricochet is equipped with a pair of glider wings that are retracted by default; extended only when the aircraft is in gliding mode.

### Control

In order to be able to deploy in kamikaze missions, Ricochet are controlled by computer chips; while these are not well understood, central control units are always equipped near to the vehicle's tip.

Such unit provides every functionality for a self-driving spacecraft, from enhanced vision to advanced control and stabilization.

It is also theorized the Ricochet central unit os equipped with [Aura Vision](alien_technology~aura_vision) for near-perfect air control; it is now known, however, how an artificial circuit could emulate such phenomenon.

## Notable instances

Few Ricochet survived the alien war; all the surviving instances were found in abandoned hangars and underground bunkers.

* **Stardust**: the traditional codename of the only Ricochet in [Neon Valley]. Found in [Abandoned NATO Bunker](neon_valley_underground) East-504, as of 269RDA is part of the exhibition in the *Museum of Extraterrestrial Craftmanship*.
    * *Stardust* is also the name of a station on Metro Line 3A, named as such due to its proximity to the aforementioned bunker.
