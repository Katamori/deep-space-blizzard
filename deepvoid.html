**Deepvoid** is the traditional name of a parallel dimension consisting of pure [antimatter]. Its physics and behavior is not well understood neither by human nor alien science, but it's well-known fact that Deepvoid is in some way inherently tied to the Known Universe.

As of 269RDA, the primary and sole purpose of using Deepvoid is for [faster-than-light travel].

## Traveling in Deepvoid

### Navigation

Due to aforementioned entanglement, patterns discovered in Deepvoid can be used to identify real-life locations; these can serve as valid exit points.

### Density

In Deepvoid, every region of space possesses an order of magnitude higher density compared to the ordinary reality. It has many consequences, one of which is that no object can enter Deepvoid without an [Aura Shield] coating active around its surface.

Aura Shields protect both from matter-antimatter annihilation and the sudden implosion due to different density and gravitational forces, which also has an extra side effect: these shields effectively "mask" the real mass of the objects they surround. 

Contrary to the misbeliefs, objects in Deepvoid **do have mass**; it's just greatly reduced (90+%) as these are tied to the mass of the sum of the exotic particles present in Aura Shields.

### Speed

Another consequence of the density difference in Deepvoid is that distances relative to their real-life counterparts are much shorter while the [speed of light] relative to Deepvoid is much higher.

These rules also implie that any object entering Deepvoid with greater-than-zero momentum has its speed greatly amplified immediately.

Adding up all the aforementioned factors, plus the fact Aura Shields eliminate any sort of material friction (including air resistance), it quickly becomes obvious that an object in Deepvoid can reach speed that relative to ordinary reality, **can exceed the speed of light**.

The only disadvantage of this phenomenon is that spacecrafts using Aura Shields can can utilize [ion drive]s only as the means of propulsion; this technology, however, has become increasingly more effective during and after the [New Age].






While the propulsion method of matter-antimatter annihilation is contained and well-used in [Antimatter Drive]s, its effects are greatly amplified in Deepvoid due to aforementioned density difference
